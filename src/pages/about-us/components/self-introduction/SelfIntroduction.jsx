                Based in New York, but spread across three continents, we love to bring together viewpoints and
                perspectives from all over the world into our brand.

                France particularly runs deep within our veins. With five perfumers located in Grasse and our
                nose/evaluator located in Paris, you canâ€™t have Dossier without that French touch.
            </p>
            <p className="s-intro-text">
                We see our customers as a vital part of our team, which is why we are always looking for new ways to
                connect. We listen to your suggestions, we develop scents based on what you love, and we always have an
                open ear to help us improve the Dossier experience.
