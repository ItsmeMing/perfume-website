And much like the resurgence of the great House itself (under the watchful eye of Alessandro Michele since 2015), Gucci’s floral fragrance is both classically elegant and subversively provocative, redefining what makes a floral fragrance, well, floral.<br/>Gucci Bloom is a nod to Gucci’s days of pure quality. The opening is lovely — a vivid view of leafy greens enclosing stalks of velvety jasmine, hidden but still subtly fragrant. Soon, you discover the fragrance’s true essence — middle notes that encompass a fierce floral heart. Jasmine explicitly introduces itself yet again, this time with greater force and vigor. Heady tuberose notes cut right through with a rich, waxy, and simply delightful scent. Plus, contributions from a flower native to South India known as Rangoon creeper, with bold, sweet overtones. Finally, the fragrance dries down to a powdery note, signaling a refined close to this floral scent.<br/>Gucci Bloom’s notes may read as overly floral on paper, but they are in no way overpowering. In fact, we love how light and subtle the floral notes here are. The floral bouquet comes through with a wispy, breezy quality. It’s a smooth blend that allows each ingredient to showcase its own unique facets.<br/>And allow us to say, Gucci Bloom is realistic. Wearing Bloom smells like you’re wearing actual flowers. And sure, we hear lots of talk about fancy floral touches in this and that, but when it comes to Bloom, it’s the real thing. Everything is fresh, au naturel, with just the right amount of sweetness and green. The absence of synthetic scents, or any hints of human interference at all, makes this a very delectable scent. And one that we certainly won’t mind having.<br/>Gucci Bloom is the first in a fantastic floral collection of scents. Each fragrance offers something truly distinctive. There’s the original Gucci Bloom perfume (the inspiration for our dupe, Floral Honeysuckle), which also comes in a three-piece gift set comprising a bottle of Gucci Bloom Eau de Parfum, rollerball, and body lotion. A spate of delightful flankers follows, including Gucci Bloom Acqua Di Fiori Eau de Toilette, Bloom Ambrosia Di Fiori Eau de Parfum, Bloom Profumo Di Fiori, and Bloom Nettare Di Fiori Eau de Parfum, which is undoubtedly the heaviest scent of the lot.<br/>Gucci’s beloved floral fragrance is all we’re looking for in a bottle of elegant, feminine perfume. For the same amounts of freshness and juicy greens, take a gander at Dossier’s Floral Honeysuckle. Our Gucci Bloom dupe embodies a similar softness you would expect from something so floral. You’ll find a familiar opening of lush green notes, complemented by notes of white flowers that glow under the warmth of evening musk."

                "content": "According to our history books, the original Opium was born in 1977, fueled by Yves Saint Laurent’s fascination with the Orient. But what they also tell us is that the fragrance was an astonishing success. It flew off shelves everywhere. Sales figures were beyond astronomical, reaching stratospheric heights never seen before. It’s safe to say that this was, at its time, the most popular perfume in the world.<br/>And now, it’s back. And completely reimagined for the modern woman. This newer, modern reimagining comes in the form of Yves Saint Laurent’s Black Opium, which was released in the fall of 2014. The fragrance was developed by Nathalie Lorson, Marie Salamagne, Honorine Blanc, and Olivier Cresp. And sure, it isn’t a new formula by any means — the creators simply gave it a contemporary twist. Nonetheless, the result is still an equally (if not more) intoxicating scent, one that rivals the original in every sense.<br/>Black Opium is a warm gourmand perfume whose beauty is as seductive as its name suggests. The fragrance is supported by an enigmatic advertising campaign, calling empowered women everywhere to step forward. It speaks directly to the strong woman of today, inspiring her to live a life that’s vibrant and brimming with confidence. And it’s a call many are answering, too — if its commercial success is anything to go by.<br/>YSL’s intoxicating Black Opium Eau de Parfum begins with a burst of orange blossom right upfront. Immediately afterward, you get slight notes of adrenaline-rich coffee beans, followed by a hint of refreshing pear. Near the middle, the fragrance reclines into the softness of white flowers, giving the fragrance a firm calmness that befits the young, elegant woman that wears it. Nearing its base, Black Opium dries into a warm, coffee-tinged gourmand scent with a sticky musk that wraps around creamy vanilla bits. It’s yummy and oh-so addictive.<br/>YSL’s Black Opium is a sweet, dark fragrance with a somewhat bitter edge. It’s not a subtle experience by any means, with a scent that constantly projects a sense of raw power and control. In other words, this isn’t a scent meant to be worn passively.<br/>In its original form, YSL Black Opium comes as an Eau de Parfum. The original EDP is also available as a gift set. For a more potent brew, you might want to look at the YSL Black Opium Eau de Parfum Intense. If that isn’t enough for you, perhaps you’d be pleased to know that a certain Black Opium EDP Extreme exists. This is a darker version of the original with fewer sweet undertones.<br/>Black Opium is a real rush to the senses. Infused with white flowers, smooth vanilla, and invigorating coffee, it’s everything we’d dared hope for in the modern woman’s perfume. We can’t get enough of it; so much so that its undertones became the inspiration behind Ambery Vanilla, our own YSL Black Opium dupe. Sensuous and yummy, our replica is the perfect scent for the woman who has the world at her feet."

                "content": "It needs no introduction: since social media has uncovered Baccarat’s Rouge 540 for men, everyone has been raving about it. We’re not that surprised — after all, it is one of the cleverest perfume compositions of recent years. But what is the story behind this iconic fragrance?<br/>Baccarat celebrates its 250th anniversary with Baccarat Rouge 540, created by the fine crystal company in partnership with globally acclaimed perfumer Francis Kurkdjian. Since its launch in 2015, Baccarat’s Rouge 540 has cemented its status as an elegantly luxurious and intense scent. Stunning and unique in every conceivable way, there’s absolutely nothing boring about its scent profile.<br/>Baccarat Rouge 540 opens with a powerful scent of amber wood. This is closely followed by notes of jasmine and cedar, which together create a fruity, sugary aroma. You’ll also get hints of rosemary, further adding to its sweet fragrance. Combined with a hearty dose of ambroxan, the fragrance gradually settles into this toasted sugar, candy floss vibe that makes everything seem addictively yummy. It’s a delicious scent that will make your mouth water.<br/>However, despite the sweet fruity notes, they don’t overpower the nose; instead, they give off a light and airy sensation. The sweetness is just right so as not to be offensive even at close proximity. At a distance, the perfume has a distinctive clean, floral aroma, one that many may find themselves drawn to.<br/>Baccarat Rouge 540 comes in two different fragrances: Extrait de Parfum and Eau de Parfum (EDP). They share the same scent, but the silage and the pricing are different.<br/>The Baccarat Rouge 540 Extrait has a little more depth, longevity, and projection than the EDP. The Extrait is also significantly denser and adds a more substantial toasted quality on top of everything else. Everything about it feels heavier and more powerful. Aside from the Eau de Parfum and Extrait de Parfum, Baccarat’s Rouge 540 is also available as a candle, hair spray, body oil, and body cream.<br/>Recent years have seen Baccarat Rouge 540 become one of the most sought-after fragrances of all time. Perhaps it even seemed to be a worthwhile investment at some point in your life. This isn’t a perfume for the price-conscious, though. A 2.4 oz bottle of Baccarat Rouge 540 will set you back $325, a price tag that safely excludes it from impulse-buy territory when you’re shopping for perfume.<br/>But at Dossier, we’re all about opening doors to the best fragrances in the world.<br/>The result is Ambery Saffron, the perfect imitation of Baccarat Rouge 540. It is now available in Dossier’s collection of quality, iconic perfume dupes as a perfect blend of opulence and affordability.<br/>Our dreamy Baccarat Rouge 540 dupe is sweet, pretty, and every bit as beautiful as the original — with a far lighter price tag. Our iteration was specially crafted to pay tribute to the depth and intoxicating spice trail that you’ll find with Baccarat’s masterpiece. It’s also not overly floral or woodsy, making it an ideal pick for both men and women."

It’s so well-known that even some of the most iconic celebrities have taken to the unisex scent, such as Alexa Chung and Justin Bieber.<br/>This is a fragrance that has transcended cult status to become something that is at the same time coveted and ubiquitous. It’s a scent celebrated by perfumistas all over, and yet still enjoyably accessible to those who don’t know it.<br/>Developed by perfumer Frank Voelkl, Le Labo’s Santal 33 was unveiled in 2011. With its woodsy-sweet scent, it has a rugged, yet not overly masculine appeal; if anything, it seems more androgynous. In any case, there is something universally sensual about this perfume, one that intoxicates both men and women alike.<br/>Santal 33 greets you with a smoky, almost leathery aroma. This is accented by a woody accord (with bits of cedar, sandalwood, and turpentine) fused with a cream-like scent (thanks to the coconut and tonka bean). Iris, papyrus, and violet make up the top and middle notes, giving it an overall floral, musky aroma. In the background, a green cedar note is briefly discernible, together with a dab of cardamom, though they don’t stay around long. Late in Santal 33’s dry-down, sandalwood’s deep, warm character completely takes over, cementing its dominant run throughout the scent.<br/>Santal 33, as a whole, gives off a subtle aroma of milk and roses mixed with dense, old woods. It’s a lovely, comforting, smooth scent as it opens and develops, although by the end, what you’re left with is a bunch of smoky, milky notes that capture the distinctive scent of Australian sandalwood. Many will love it — others not so much. But regardless of how you look at it, this is a very mature scent, one that is suited for anyone so inclined to appreciate the finer side of life.<br/>Le Labo’s Santal 33 collection is available as an Eau de Parfum, body wash, body lotion, and candle.<br/>Unfortunately, there is a downside to Le Labo’s signature scent, and that’s the price. It’s not cheap. On the plus side though, you can get the same scent for much less.<br/>Enter Woody Sandalwood. This Le Labo’s Santal 33 dupe from Dossier.co is a lot cheaper than the original, and uses 100% Indian sandalwood — an ingredient rawer, earthier, and creamier than its Australian counterpart. The result is a much richer scent, one that strikes an ideal balance between the sharpness of woody notes and the smoothness of floral notes."

But above all, it implies a sense of being free, unencumbered by expectations and self-imposed constraints.</br>It’s in this very spirit that YSL introduced the powerful, gender-bending YSL Libre Eau de Parfum — a scent for those who lead lives of their own design. And indeed, Libre is the fragrance of freedom. Freedom to express yourself. Freedom to choose. Freedom to live life to the fullest.<br/>Libre makes an impressive first impression with a warm, sparkling curtain of citrus. Top notes include mandarin orange, blackcurrant, and lavender, while the heart notes are orange blossom and jasmine. The scent begins herbaceous but transitions into a lovely musk with notes such as Madagascar vanilla, ambergris accord, and cedarwood oil. The overall scent is pleasant, and a touch lighter than most florals.<br/>But perhaps the most interesting aspect of this fragrance lies in its stubborn refusal to conform to gender-specific olfactory conventions. And certainly, it wouldn’t be fair to call YSL Libre a purely feminine fragrance. No, there’s more to it than that. There is just something extremely sensual about the marriage of masculine lavender and feminine orange blossom absolute that, in the end, makes for a fragrance that’s really neither for him nor for her. It’s a soft, androgynous scent that straddles the line between two extremes: less intense than a gourmand and more muted than a chypré. Women looking for something less sweet and sharp will love Libre, while men with an affinity for fougère notes will find it inexplicably appealing.<br/>This is a powdery, sensual, and floral fragrance that lasts for upwards of eight hours from one spritz. And much like a pair of classic diamond studs, Libre is a fragrance that can be worn just about anywhere and at any time. We find it perfect for a night at the club, while also being appropriate for a more conservative daytime activity like work or a meeting.<br/>YSL Libre is available in two concentrations, an Eau de Parfum and a lighter, cleaner Eau de Toilette. The perfume also comes in a pretty three-piece gift set featuring a full-size Eau de Parfum, a travel-size Eau de Parfum, and a nourishing Libre body balm. Also available is YSL Libre Intense Eau de Parfum, a flanker to the original that adds even more power and sensuality.<br/>YSL Libre is a fresh, luxurious, and innovative perfume for the mind, body, and soul. Definitely one of our favorites. If you’re in the mood for something just as pleasant, with well-composed notes and unique character, consider Dossier’s Floral Lavender. Intriguing, joyful, and warm, our YSL Libre dupe perfume is gender-free and doesn’t compromise on the scent. It’s a replica of the original YSL Libre that pushes the bounds of sensuality, creating a scent that evokes raw confidence, beauty and sophistication."

Inspired by the wild woods, this unique blend features delicious notes of pepper, Calabrian bergamot, and vetiver. It's a combination effortlessly masculine yet sensual, a rugged beauty that breathes life into the skin.<br/>Christian Dior first introduced the fragrance to the world in 2015. Fast forward almost a decade, and Dior Sauvage is still one of the most popular men's fragrances ever created.<br/>Sauvage comes in several variants: Dior Sauvage Eau de Parfum, Eau de Toilette, Eau de Cologne, and more recently, the Sauvage Elixir. This perfume was created by the legendary François Demachy, Dior's master fragrance craftsman.<br/>Dior Sauvage has a distinct, fresh citrusy scent that is more masculine than most fragrances. This raw concoction opens with a wonderfully rich bergamot layer, topped with a subtle peppery note. This is then accompanied by a flowery chorus of amberwood, vetiver, patchouli for a powerful but smooth finish.<br/>Far from musky, the fragrance evokes an unusual freshness infused with an invigorating morning mist. It's a scent reminiscent of wild woods --- unbridled yet strangely self-aware, addictive in every way.<br/>Dior's exuberant portrayal of masculinity in Sauvage is refreshing and undoubtedly contributed significantly to its phenomenal reception at launch.<br/>The fragrance has also been praised for its longevity. A few sprays can easily keep you fresh for more than 7 hours. In addition, Dior Sauvage quickly fills any room with elegance thanks to an excellent projection of up to 5 feet.<br/>If you're searching for a fresh, citrusy fragrance, this Sauvage inspired fragrance is an affordable offer that fits any budget .<br/>Dossier's Aromatic Star Anise is a Dior Sauvage dupe that's more sophisticated and richer than anything else available in the market. Designed based on the traditional French fragrance formula Fougere, which consists of a citrus scent with lavender, geranium, and patchouli notes, our take on this popular eau de toilette seduces all kinds of customers, with zero compromises on scent.<br/>Our Dior Sauvage dupe radiates a fresh, spicy flavor. Aside from the citrus note, you also get a delicious blend of juicy Calabrian bergamot, mandarin notes, and spiced star anise."

Green, aromatic, and incredibly fresh, Creed’s Green Irish Tweed fits right into this category. Natural woodiness meets pure masculinity in this delectable concoction that never strays too far into overwhelming territory.<br/>A masterpiece by the legendary Olivier Creed, this fragrance is definitely one of the best ever created by the Creed house. In retrospect, this was the scent that set the Creed house on its skyrocketing trajectory, propelling it to the top of the olfactory charts during its release back in 1985.<br/>The old adage holds true: a classic never goes out of style. Similarly, Green Irish Tweed is a timeless classic, effortlessly relevant, and impeccable. No surprise, then, that Creed Green Irish Tweed is still one of the oldest fragrances produced and sold worldwide today.<br/>Creed Green Irish Tweed opens with aromatic lemon and verbena, perfectly cooled down with a hint of peppermint. We’d describe the scent as mossy and earthy, with a citrusy kick provided by the lemon verbena. What we like most about this fragrance is how nicely it settles into its heart – transforming into an incredibly refined and elegant aroma that’s very easy to like. Also present in an arrangement of geranium and lavender that helps create the classic fougère structure. To finish it off, a deep, rich cedarwood scent is sprinkled over bright oakmoss, creating a scent that’s at the same time uplifting and distinctly forest-like.<br/>Creed Green Irish Tweed shares several similarities with another iconic scent – Creed Aventus. These are probably the two most popular perfumes from the French perfume house today. And one question we often get is: which one should I pick? How would you rank Creed Green Irish Tweed vs. Creed Aventus?<br/>Both fragrances smell strong and masculine while remaining fairly woody. But that’s about where their similarities end. For one, Aventus smells sweet and citrusy. On the other hand, Green Irish Tweed comes across as fresh and woody with fewer sweeter notes.<br/>This scent profile makes Creed Aventus an excellent choice for any weather and any situation. In contrast, we’d save Creed’s Green Irish Tweed cologne for cooler weather (think spring) or evening dates since it has a more mature, refined scent.<br/>Creed perfumes are some of the most sophisticated fragrances in the world, and Creed aficionados claim they’re impossible to dupe. Whether or not that’s true, what we do know for sure is that Creed perfumes are, of course, super expensive and out of reach for most people. So, what’s a Creed devotee to do when he or she wants Creed’s signature Green Irish Tweed but can’t justify the $320 price tag for a 50 ml (1.7 oz) bottle? Try this: Dossier’s Green Verbena. Our Creed Green Irish Tweed dupe gives hints of woodsy and earthy smells, reminiscent of the original fragrance, but for only a fraction of the price. Discover our Creed Green Irish Tweed dupe for a powerful, elegant, and effortlessly masculine fragrance."

                "content": "J’Adore Parfum by Christian Dior is a fruity floral fragrance launched in 1999. Infused with a feminine, classy, elegant, and sophisticated aroma, J’Adore is a sensual perfume that charms in a subtle, ladylike manner.<br/>Dior likens its J’Adore fragrance to the perfect bouquet – elegant and meticulously crafted – a floral arrangement made to order. Quite a claim, for sure. But one that we can certainly get behind. Using Comoros ylang-ylang, Damask rose, and Arabian jasmine as its primary ingredients, Dior J’Adore Eau de Parfum provides an exotic floral bouquet like no other. With a flawless balance of sensuality and intensity, here is a composition that brings together opposites to produce an alluring, mysterious floral ensemble.<br/>The opening of Dior J’Adore contains a punching essence of bergamot, followed by fruity and fresh flavors of pear and melon. Damask rose, luxurious and exuberant, adds a soft exotic touch with its soft and enveloping fragrance. At this point, the floral bouquet manifests itself in its entirety, displaying a dazzling array of lilies of the valley, tuberose, magnolia, and more. And just before the scent moves into its final act, a chorus of Jasmines bursts forth to envelop the wearer with a sense of sensuality. Then comes the base notes, which are a mixture of woody with a little floral – a pine scent on top of a cedar cream, with hints of vanilla and blueberry.<br/>Overall, we find this to be a sweet, crowd-pleasing scent. There’s a feeling of youth and vitality but with a certain sense of sophistication. Considering that it’s such a luxurious and exceptional fragrance, it’s easy to see why this would be a favorite for formal dinners, black-tie parties, or even work.                <br/>The floral scent holds up well to humidity in warmer weather. Many people mistake it for a loud scent, but it’s actually quite soft. This does not, however, mean it is weak. Especially since this is an Eau de parfum, you will still smell J’adore. Expect a full day of wear with this EDP – easily over eight hours of solid performance.<br/>Dior J’Adore is a sophisticated, elegant floral fragrance. And despite being released in 1999, it remains popular to this day. It’s so iconic and distinct that several reinterpretations have been brought to market over the years. We’ve seen the likes of: Dior J’Adore L’absolu, Dior J’Adore in Joy, Dior J’Adore Eau de Parfum Infinissime, as well as Dior J’Adore L’Or. <br/>Elegant, feminine, and quintessentially French, Dior’s J’Adore Eau de Parfum exceeds all expectations. It’s the kind of perfume that makes you feel beautiful and confident, as though you’re wearing something extra special (which you are!). You can get a similar experience at a much more affordable price with Dossier’s own Dior J’Adore dupe – Fruity Jasmine. Our replica captures all the luminous, radiant aspects of the iconic floral scent while providing a burst of freshness that is sure to captivate any nose within reach."

                "content": "Bleu de Chanel is a perfume that has become synonymous with the luxury fashion house. The timeless classic was introduced in 2010 and has remained a favorite among perfume connoisseurs ever since, thanks to its aromatic, fresh, and unmistakably Chanel grapefruit scent.<br/>Bleu’s scent begins at the bottom of the forest floor while slowly rising to the top, clinging to mosses, barks, and leaves to create a stunning canopy of fresh pine.<br/>Citrus and spice are the key opening notes of this cologne. The scent begins with a burst of tart grapefruit and creamy bergamot. While citrus notes are more prominent in the opening act, these are soon followed by the spicier, minty notes from coriander and pepper. Underneath all of this is a slowly arising warm amber, smelling slightly of smoky incense. Glimpses of its true woody nature emerge as the smell takes a delightfully rustic turn. Featuring calming elements of fruit, flowers, and earthy spice, Bleu’s middle notes are very much woodland-like, adding to the blissful chill of being in a pine forest in the mountains. But it’s in the base notes that Bleu de Chanel reaches its peak of freshness. Aromas of rough cedars stand in striking contrast with the sylvan sandalwood from New Caledonia, giving off an overall pleasing, creamy texture to the fragrance.<br/>Overall, we love how the clash of the hard and the smooth lends the scent a vigorous character. Early citrusy scents lend a feeling of lightness to the fragrance without taking away from its serious nature. Meanwhile, the woody and spicy notes (accompanied by a hint of fresh greens) provide Bleu with a pleasing depth and give it a much more masculine aesthetic.<br/>The scent’s staying power, of course, varies according to the concentration you choose. For instance, the Bleu de Chanel Eau de Parfum (EDP) will easily stay on the skin for more than 7 hours. The Bleu de Chanel Parfum, however, is more concentrated and lasts for over 12 hours.<br/>Projection starts out rather strong but gradually settles near the wearer. Not enough to take out a room, but definitely noticeable by someone a few feet away.<br/>Bleu de Chanel has a more formal, sophisticated presence, so it makes for a superb office scent and is excellent for black-tie events. Don’t be afraid to try the fragrance in a more casual setting, such as for an evening out in the city or when you go shopping.<br/>Luxury brands are continuing to push the envelope with innovative new products. Bleu is no exception to the rule, coming in 20 different variants on the perfumer’s website — including a Bleu de Chanel gift set. But don’t let that scare you. There are really only three main fragrances in the collection: Bleu de Chanel Eau De Toilette (EDT), Bleu de Chanel Eau de Parfum, and a stronger Bleu de Chanel Parfum. The Bleu Eau de Toilette is a breath of fresh air with light citrusy notes; the Eau de Parfum, on the other hand, is slightly more formal and has a stronger woody tone.<br/>Also available from the house are Bleu de Chanel deodorant stick, shower gel, moisturizer, and shaving cream.<br/>Inspired by Chanel’s quintessential fragrance, Dossier’s Citrus Ginger presents the same sophisticated combination of woody and citrus notes you’d find in Bleu, with zero compromises and for a fraction of the price. With its clean and masculine scent, Citrus Ginger is a Bleu de Chanel dupe that’s guaranteed to bring out the best in any man."

Taking cues from the power of conquest, strength, and romantic soul, Creed’s iconic cologne grants an undeniable sense of confidence, allowing men all over the world to start each day fresh with sanguine confidence. But what does Creed Aventus smell like?<br/>Creed Aventus is a unique blend of woody, sweet, and citrusy scents.<br/>Aventus opens with a refreshing pineapple note — a bold yet aggressive choice unlike any other. Fresh apple and bergamot add to its juicy sharpness, providing even more tartness to the composition. Skilled perfume connoisseurs might also pick up on the faint hints of blackcurrant that further intensify the fruity fragrance. An aftertaste of smoky flavor may accompany the first fruity blast. This is the birch, which keeps its sharpness but adds some power and anchor to the composition. It acts as a vital component of the blend, keeping it from becoming overly sweet or tangy. Finally, Creed Aventus rounds it all off with a pleasant yet slightly musky vanilla note, leaving behind a lingering fragrance that embodies the courage and ability of a true Napoleon.<br/>The scent may linger on your skin for over 12 hours, which is impressive as far as perfumes go. Aventus also has excellent projection and sillage, making it noticeable even from a distance.<br/>Naturally all this comes with a price tantamount to the Creed Aventus’ iconic status. The Creed brand is a luxury house with a specialty in luxury fragrances. And at $335 per 1.7 Fl oz bottle, Aventus sits comfortably at the top premium range of its products. Remember that above a certain price point, you’re not just paying for the fragrance — you’re paying for the brand, for the bottle, and for the market’s perception of the fragrance’s value.<br/>Having enjoyed great success with Aventus for Men, Creed decided to deliver their approach of a more feminine version, Aventus for Her. Introduced in 2016, the new fragrance drew inspiration from the most influential women of history — monarchs, queens, and heads of state — as well as modern women who constantly challenge convention. The Aventus for Her Eau de Parfum shares the same woody and fruity undertones as its masculine counterpart.<br/>Taking inspiration from Creed Aventus, Dossier’s Musky Oakmoss embodies similar characteristics of strength, power, and success. Our Creed Aventus clone is engineered to reflect the same taste notes as Creed’s masterpiece. With the same fruity punch swinging in tandem with a soft, subtle musk-infused undertone, our Creed Aventus dupe hits all the right notes when it comes to quality, excellence, and class — all at a fraction of the original cost."
